# H-Bridge DC Motor Controller

To be able to control a DC motor in varying speed and direction, an h-brige motor controller is essential. This pcb design uses PMOS and NMOS field-effect transistors to control the direction of current flowing to a DC motor, allowing for it to be controlled in different ways using a microcontroller.

It also includes opto-electronic oscillators for ensuring voltage spikes and unforseen current draws from rather noisy DC motors do not affect a microcontroller connected to it. It makes available screw terminals for connecting.
